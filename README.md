# toxic-comments-fastai-pytorch
Analyzing Jigsaw's toxic comments Kaggle challenge using fastai + pytorch

This is a work in progress repository developing a demo for http://dlabctawg.github.io/

Initially intended for Google Colab, but those GPUs are too slow for the language model training. Currently based on FloydHub instead: https://www.floydhub.com/cekaos/projects/toxic-comments-fastai-pytorch/
